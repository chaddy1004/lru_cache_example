# lru_cache_example
VERY simple code snippet (for my reference) on using lru_cache in Python.


How to use [lru_cache](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html) provided by [functools](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html) in Python. It allows for a recursion function to be "converted" into DP methodology (that uses memoization).

The example code solves problem 935 in Leetcode titled [Knight Dialer](https://leetcode.com/problems/knight-dialer/).
